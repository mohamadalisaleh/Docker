1. Make sure you have a virtualbox with Ubuntu installed.
The machine must have at least 20GB of storage.
If it does not have that, please reinstall the VM.

2. Install Docker

3. Install MiniKube:
https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/

4. Create a POD with Nginx using kubectl command

>> kubectl create -f nginx 

5. Create a POD with Nginx using a yaml file.

>> kubectl create -f nginx.yml
>> apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
  namespace: default
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80

6. Using kubectl port-forward access the nginx web page.

>>kubectl port-forward pods/nginx 8080:80
>> localhost:8080

7. Edit the image of the container in the pod and deploy it.

>> kubectl edit pods/nginx -o yaml

8. Create a ClusterIP service and connect it to the pod.

9. Create an external service (nodeport or loadbalancer) and connect it to the POD.

>>  kubectl create service nodeport nginx --tcp=80:80

10. Create a deployment instead of the pod.
    - Why should we use deployment and not ReplicaSet or POD objects?

>> kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx

11. Connect your external services to the deployment.

12. Scale your application to 3 instances.

13. Go inside each pod and edit the index.html file and try to access the nginx web site. 
    -  Did it change?

14. Create a namespace for the new deployment and move the deployment created to that namespace.

15. Can you use the same service to connect to the deployment now?

16. Create a 3 yaml files that hold all the configuration created:
    - Namespace
    - Deployment
    - Service

Good luck!
